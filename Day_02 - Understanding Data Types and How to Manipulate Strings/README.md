# Goals of Day_02

* Learn how to manage float and int types
* Do easy calculations 

You need to declare the amount of the bill to be paid, the tip of the bill and how many people will split the bill.  

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Round the result to 2 decimal places.
