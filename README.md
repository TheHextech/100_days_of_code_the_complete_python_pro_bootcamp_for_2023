This is a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) taught by Dr. Angela Yu to learn how to code in **Python programming language**. All along the course are proposed "daily challenges" and project to do. It's a fantastic and progressive difficulty course! 

## Why am I posting this course on Github?

I wanted to cheat the course and provide all the solutions. eheheh... Um, Iâ€™m joking! 

Since I started programming in Python (it was April '21) a lot has happened and my progression in this course has never been linear. However, I went back to review the notes I made for this course when I needed to review something and I always found the material in the course really good. 

So, one day I decided to organize all these "daily projects" on Github, adding my own notes for each project and creating useful repositories for a quick future review, thinking that it would be useful for others as well.
