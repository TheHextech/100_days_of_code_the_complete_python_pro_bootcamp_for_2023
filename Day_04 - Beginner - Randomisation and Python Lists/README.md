# Goals of the Day_04

* Learn the random module 
* Combine random module to if, elif, else statements to create a game

The trickiest part of the game is to create the correct flow of if, elif, else statements to enstablish if the match is a win, a lose or a tie. It may be very useful to create a schema on a paper!

Note: I added the while loop to make the game repeat if desired and added an if statements to punish troll attitude (if the user will choose a different option from the default options).

Note2: rock, paper and scissors are strings, copied and pasted from an ASCII ART site.
